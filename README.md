# Data Structure Studies

This semester, I have been focused on studying linear data structures and algorithms as part of a new course in my university program. I learned about various sorting algorithms and explored different types of trees, including Binary Search Trees (BST), multi-way trees, AVL trees, and Red-Black trees. These topics not only enhanced my understanding of fundamental data structures but also deepened my knowledge of efficient algorithms for data manipulation and search. This has been a rewarding experience, and I've gained valuable insights that will support my future work in computer science.

In this repository, you will find all the code produced during this semester as part of the new data structures course. It includes implementations of the algorithms and data structures I've studied and developed.
